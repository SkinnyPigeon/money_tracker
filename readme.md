Feel free to download this and have a wee play.

First things first, we need to clone this and make sure that the local host is working.

**INSTALLATION**

You need node.js installed globally:

`$ git clone https://github.com/SkinnyPigeon/money_tracker_test`  
`$ cd money_tracker_test`  
`$ npm install`  
`$ npm start`

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser.

You should now be on the main page of the application.
